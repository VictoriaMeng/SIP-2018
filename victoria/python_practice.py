# Python Practice Problems

# Don't forget to print() your answers to the console!
# Google or check Python documentation for functions you don't remember!


# Strings:

# 1. Given the string 'hello', give an index command that returns 'e'.
# 2. Then, give two methods of retrieving the letter 'o' from 'hello' using indexing.
s = 'hello'


# Lists:

# 1. Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead
list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]

# 2. Sort the list below
list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]


# Tuples:
# What is the major difference between tuples and lists?
# (Type answer here.)

# How do you create a tuple?
# (Type answer here.)


# Statements
# 1. Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':
st1 = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'

# 2. Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10.

# 3. Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"
st2 = 'Print even for every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'

# 4. Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100:
#   - For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number
#   - For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number
#   - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.


# Functions (Warmup):
# 1. LESSER OF TWO EVENS: Write a function that:
#   -Returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even
#   -But returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd

# 2. Write a function that:
#   -Takes a two-word string and returns True if both words begin with same letter

# 3. MAKES TWENTY: Write a function that:
#   -Given two integers, return True if the sum of the integers is 20 OR if one of the integers is 20.
#   -If not, return False

# Functions (Level 1):
# 1. Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name
#   -HINT: If you're stuck, look up the String.replace() and capitalize() functions
#   -HINT: String.replace() doesn't change the original string, but variables can always be reassigned...

# 2. Write a function that given a sentence, returns with the words reversed
#   -HINT: The split() and join() functions may be useful here
#   -string_name[::-1] is a commonly used syntax to reverse Strings
